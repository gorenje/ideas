# Ideas that will never see the light of day.

Here is a list of ideas that will never see the light of day but that
are interesting nonetheless.

If you decide to "borrow" any of the ideas here, then please give the
author at least a heads-up. All ideas are Copyleft and free to use in
whatever way the reader wishes.

Ordering is based on random selection.

DISCLAIMER: The author does not suggest that any of these ideas are good
nor that they should be ever implemented nor that anyone should come to harm
reading, implementing or using these ideas.

## Facebook Revival Button

Revive loved ones by simply clicking a button. This sounds rather gruesome,
and actually it is, but hear me out.

Aim would be to allow designated users to revive someone on Facebook (FB) who
has passed away. Who could do this would be designated by the user before
their passed away.

An FB user would be replaced by an Artifical Intelligence (AI) that
has been trained on the persons passed behaviour on FB. It would include
things such as messages, posted, likes, comments, .... basically all
and every activity of the user.

The AI would then behaviour as the user did, it would not just repeat what
the user said or did, but "act" like them. This would mean that the AI would
initiate interaction with other users, if that that was the way the dead person
acted.

Example of this would be the dead person would always post a specific
message about football games or teams to a specific group after a game,
then the AI would also do this.

The AI would also post similar postings as the person being simulated.
Absolutely all activity, what ever it was, would be simulated by the AI.

The purpose would be to lessen the grieving of friends and relatives.
However, eventually the simulation would stop.

Interestingly current AI research is not too far away from making this
possible. In fact, there are lots of independent projects that would
be able to provide the pieces for individual components of the simulation.

One only has to look at [Facebook Research](https://github.com/facebookresearch)
to see that there is a lot of research going on in this direction.

## Reputation Badge

Similar to what [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) provides, this would
provide a reputation service for all users of the internet.

What exactly goes into the reputation would be open and available to
all. The user would be able to provide links to services that they
use regularly and the service would "evaluate" them on those services.

Although other users of the service would also be able to provide "reviews"
of users. This would work similar to StackOverflow where you may only
start providing answers after enough other users have up-voted you
previous comments.

The scale would be odd, i.e. 1 to 5, 1 to 7, ..., so that a neutral middle
value is available for users who do not have a reputation.

## Herb Bike

Have a bike trailer that is growing and selling herbs. Ideally the trailer
would be about as big as car since then it could be parked in a car space
in a city. Thus making good use of city car parking space.

## Chicken aways, an omelette a day.

Bike trailer containing chickens which can easily be transported to local
parks where the chickens may roam freely.

This idea is similar to having bees in cities or doing urban gardening, just
with chickens.

A minimum amount of space per chicken is around 0.37 square meters,
which means that around 1.5 square meters would be fine for four chickens.
Since bike trailers should not be much wider than a meter (so that it can
still travel down bike lanes), it would need to be at least 1.5 meters
long.

A lot of what now follows came from
[this description](https://abundantpermaculture.com/mobile-chicken-coop/)
of a mobile chicken coop. In fact, one could just convert that design
to a bike trailer.

1. Two stories with a floor of mesh to minimise cleaning. The floor would
   also have beams so that the chickens may stand.

2. Second story would contain the four nesting boxes which would
   be assessible from the outside. These would be located on the side
   of the trailer, with each side having two.

   It might be diffificult to find crates in the right dimension since
   they can not be longer than 0.5 meters since the trailer is only a meter
   wide.

3. Mobile mesh fence for fencing-off chickens when they are released.

## Adtek - LTV > CPI

Aim is to provide an analytics tool that allows marketeers to compare
Cost per Install (CPI) with the Lifetime Value (LTV) of users. Main focus
of the campaigns are user acquistion, not user retention.

Context is mobile applications and internet advertising, which is notorious
for its analytical inaccuracies.

Core features:

1. Collect reporting data from Advertiser Networks (AdNetworks) which includes
   spends and revenue. Revenue being the money made by showing in-app
   advertising. Spends being the money spent in placing advertising, both
   online and in-app (other applications).
2. Compute the LTV of users based on internal data. LTV is an estimation
   of what users spend in the application.
3. Tracking clicks and installs, and associate these with one another.

This was implemented but never saw the light of day. Codebase is mostly
available on [github](https://github.com/adtekio).
